# NUS High GPA Calculator
*A small and simple tool to calculate your grade point average.*

## How do I use it?
Go to [gohjy.github.io/nush-gpa-calc](https://gohjy.github.io/nush-gpa-calc). 
Be warned though, it may not work well on some screen sizes (though it *should* be fine on computers and phones).

## How does it work?
The calculator pulls data from the school's Programme of Studies (through [this repo](https://github.com/gohjy/nush-pos-data)) and filters through it. 

## Is it accurate?
Probably, but you'd want to check through yourself to make sure as well. This is just a tool to make your life easier.

## Is this official?
No.

## Is it available offline?
Not right now, but I might make one in the future. No plans yet though.

## Hold up, isn't POS data school confidential?
Nope, it's on the school's website [here](https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/studying-at-nus-high/the-nus-high-diploma/programme-of-studies/).

## Wait... I have another question!
You're probably better off not asking. Like I said, this is not official, you don't need to worry so much about it.
